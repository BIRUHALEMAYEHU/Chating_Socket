This project is submitted as part of the Advanced Programming course at Adama Science and Technology University, Department of Software Engineering.

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a chat application using socket programming in Java. It consists of two components:
1 server: Listens for client connections and facilitates interactive messaging.
2 client: Connects to the server and exchanges messages with it.

How It Works
 The server runs on a specified port (default: 12345).
 The client connects to the server on the same port.
 Both client and server can send and receive messages interactively.
Typing `exit` ends the chat and closes the connection.

If You Want to Run This Program
 Clone this repository to your local machine.
 Compile the Java files:
 Start the server in one terminal:
 Start the client in another terminal:
